        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>What's so great about combining the worlds of coding and cuisine?
        Dev Dish was founded by two passionate developers who turned their love 
        for software into a culinary adventure. After years of coding by day and 
        cooking by night, they decided to merge their two passions and create something 
        extraordinary.</p>

        <p>Dev Dish brings a unique twist to the food truck scene, offering a menu full of 
        creative, tech-inspired dishes. Whether you're a tech enthusiast or a food lover, 
        our offerings are designed to satisfy both your appetite and your curiosity.</p>

        <p>Dev Dish is the brainchild of Alex and Jamie, two friends who met at a hackathon
        and discovered a shared love for innovative cuisine. With a background in software 
        development and a knack for culinary creativity, they embarked on a journey to deliver 
        delicious, tech-themed dishes to the community.</p>
